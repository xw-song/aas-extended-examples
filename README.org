* Applied Analytic Statistics

The notebooks in this repository are being written for use in the course Applied
Analytic Statistics. Each of the directories, =example-<n>= contains two
notesbooks: =example-<n>-questions.ipynb= and =example-<n>-answers.ipynb=. The
/questions/ notebook contains the questions for the practical sessions and the
/answers/ one has partial answers. Please give the questions a solid attempt
before looking at the answers.

** Jupyter Lab

The =shell.nix= file describes a package for running the notebooks in this
repository. To activate the notebook server run the following command.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nix-shell --command "jupyter lab" 
#+END_SRC

To keep the notebooks in a neat state, please restart the kernel and run all
cells prior to commiting any changes.
